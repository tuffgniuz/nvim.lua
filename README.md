## Summary
</div>

My personal Neovim setup, optimized for development productivity and powered by rocks.nvim for seamless plugin management. Currently requires neovim nightly to support [rocks.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim)

### Installation

To use my Neovim configuration, it is crucial to have the Neovim nightly version installed, particularly version 0.10 or later, because my setup leverages `rocks.nvim`, a plugin manager that, as of now, requires features only present in these nightly builds of Neovim. For further details and to meet all necessary prerequisites, consult the documentation of `rocks.nvim`. Additionally, ensure you have `rocks.nvim` itself installed to fully benefit from the features in my configuration.
